# Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is a more complex dataset

In this implementation I am using a complex dataset (Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset), multiple classifiers, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection.

I am implementing multiple classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine). I am also performing hyperparameter tuning for the Gradient Boosting classifier using GridSearchCV. 

Feature selection is applied to enhance the model's performance. The code loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains and evaluates the classifiers, and prints classification reports for each classifier.

In other situation, might be need more sophisticated preprocessing, more extensive hyperparameter search, and potentially more advanced techniques for model evaluation and improvement.
